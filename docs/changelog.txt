FEproc changelog
----------------

0.3.5 - 29. July 2004
---------------------
* Fixed fieldareaset handler (sorry) so it actually got the correct field
  values. all tests (identical etc. now work :)
* Changed some translations from Fetax to FeProc :)
+ Added a fileexists handler, which checks for a local file existing.
  It may not be too secure - so use with caution!

0.3.4 - 29. July 2003
--------------------
First release from Klavs Klavsen, the new maintainer.
- Changed all occurences of old version numbers to the correct one and other
small cleanups.
- Changed the Validate formarea handler to use the form
  {array:field} instead of just field and presuming the field is in the
  attributes array. This means you can now validate directly on fields from the
  Form's (f.ex.) - instead of having to create stages that copies the values
  needed to the attribute array.
- added a validate function called checkdomain, that does a whois lookup on
  com,net,org,info,biz and dk domains and tells you if they are available or
  taken.
  NB. This depends on phpwhois, which I have not included in the package (yet
  atleast).
